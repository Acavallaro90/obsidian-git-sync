- To enable asynchronous replication from one bucket to another bucket in the same or different region
	- Must enable versioning in source and destination buckets
	- Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
	- Same-Region Replication (SRR)
	- Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
- Copying is asynchronous (behind the scenes)
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
- Use cases
	- CRR
		- Compliance
		- Lower latency access
		- Replication across accounts
	- SRR
		- Log aggregation
