- Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
- It's advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage
- Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
- Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well
- Use cases
	- Backup and storage
	- Disaster recovery
	- Archive
	- Hybrid Cloud storage
	- Application hosting
	- Media hosting
	- Data lakes
	- Big data analytics
	- Software delivery
	- Static website
- Amazon S3 Buckets
	- Allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
	- Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions and all accounts)
	- Buckets are defined at the region level
	- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
	- Naming convention
		- No uppercase
		- No underscore
		- 3-63 characters long
		- Not an IP address
		- Must start with a lowercase letter or number
		- Must not start with the prefix xn--
		- Must not end with the suffix -s3alias
- Amazon S3 Objects
	- Objects (files) have a key
		- The key is the FULL path to the object
			- Example: my_folder2/another_folder/my_file.txt would be a key to this object
		- The key is composed of a prefix and the object name
			- Prefix: my_folder2/another_folder/
			- Object name: my_file.txt
	- There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
	- They are just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/")
	- Max object size is 5TB (5,000GB)
	- If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload"
	- Metadata
		- List of text key/value pairs
		- System or user metadata
	- Tags
		- Unicode key/value pair
		- Up to 10
		- Useful for security/lifecycle
	- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
