- Two kinds of IP addresses
	- IPv4
		- Internet Protocol version 4 (4.3 billion addresses)
		- Public IPv4
			- Can be used on the internet
			- EC2 instance gets a new public IP address every time you stop then start the instance by default
		- Private IPv4
			- Can be used on private networks (LAN) such as internal AWS networking (e.g. 192.168.1.1)
			- Private IPv4 is constant for EC2 instances even if you start/stop them
	- IPv6
		- Internet Protocol version 6 (3.4 * 10^38 addresses)
		- Every IP address is public
		- Example: 2001:db8:3333:4444:cccc:dddd:eeee:ffff
- Elastic IP: allows you to attach a fixed public IPv4 address to an EC2 instance
	- Note: has ongoing cost if not attached to EC2 instance or if the EC2 instance is stopped
