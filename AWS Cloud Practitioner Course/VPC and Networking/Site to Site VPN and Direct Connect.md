- Site to Site VPN
	- Connect an on premises VPN to AWS
	- The connection is automatically encrypted
	- Goes over the public internet
	- Simple, fast to setup
	- Some concerns with bandwidth and security concerns even though it is encrypted
		- Concerns stem from being transmitted over the public internet
	- On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway
	- AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway
	- Connection goes as follows:
		- Data center -> Customer Gateway -> Site to Site VPN -> Virtual Private Gateway (in VPC) -> EC2 instance (in private subnet)
- Direct Connect (DX)
	- Establishes a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
	- The connection is private, secure, and fast
	- Goes over the private network
	- Much more expensive
	- Takes at least a month to establish
