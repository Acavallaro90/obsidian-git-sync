- Network Access Control List (NACL)
	- A firewall which controls traffic from and to a subnet
	- Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
	- Are attached at the subnet level
	- Rules only include IP addresses
- Security Groups
	- A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI or EC2 instance
		- ENI: Elastic Network Interface
	- Can have only ALLOW rules
	- Rules include IP addresses and other security groups
- Differences between the two
	- NACL is at the subnet level
	- Security groups are at the EC2 instance level inside the subnet
- Complete set of differences
	- Security Groups
		- Operates at the instance level
		- Supports allow rules only
		- Is stateful; return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules
		- We evaluate all rules before deciding whether to allow traffic
		- Applies to an instance only if someone specifies the security group when launching the instance, or associates the security group with the instance later on
	- Network ACL
		- Operates at the subnet level
		- Supports allow and deny rules
		- Is stateless; return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules
		- We process rules in number order when deciding whether to allow traffic
		- Automatically applies to all instances in the subnets it's associated with (therefore, you don't have to rely on users to specify the security group)
