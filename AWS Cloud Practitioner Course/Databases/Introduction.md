- Storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, EC2 Instance Store, S3) can have its limits
- To have a structured way of storing data, use a database
- You can structure the data
- You build indexes to efficiently query/search through the data
- You define relationships between your datasets
- Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes and constraints
- Types of databases
	- Relational databases
		- Looks just like Excel spreadsheets with links between them
		- Can use the SQL language to perform queries/lookups
	- NoSQL
		- Non-relational databases
		- Are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications
		- Benefits
			- Flexibility
				- Easy to evolve data model
			- Scalability
				- Designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters
			- High performance
				- Optimized for a specific data model
			- Highly functional
				- Types optimized for the data model
		- Examples
			- Key-value
			- Document
				- JSON
			- Graph
			- In-memory
			- Search
- Shared Responsibility Model
	- AWS offers to manage different databases
	- Benefits
		- Quick provisioning
		- High availability
		- Vertical scaling
		- Horizontal scaling
		- Automated backup
		- Automated restore
		- Operations
		- Upgrades
		- Operating System patching is handled by AWS
		- Monitoring
		- Alerting
		- Note: many database technologies can be run on EC2, but you must handle yourself the resiliency, backup, patching, high availability, fault tolerance, scaling, etc.
