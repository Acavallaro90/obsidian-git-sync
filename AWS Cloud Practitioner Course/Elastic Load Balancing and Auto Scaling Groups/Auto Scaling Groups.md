- In real life, the load on your websites and applications can change
- In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
- The goal of an Auto Scaling Group is
	- Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
	- Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
	- Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
	- Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
	- Replace unhealthy instances
- Cost savings because you run at an optimal capacity at all times (principle of the cloud)
- Three settings for auto scaling groups
	- Minimum size
		- Fewest number of EC2 instances allowed
	- Actual/desired size
		- Actual state
	- Maximum size
		- Most number of EC2 instances allowed
