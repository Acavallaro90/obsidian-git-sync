- Under EC2 main menu, choose Load Balancers from the left-hand side
- Choose Create Load Balancer
- Choose the load balancer type
- Give the load balancer a name
- Choose whether the load balancer is internal or external facing
	- Internal is used by internal people only
	- External is used by external internet traffic
		- Requires a public subnet
- Choose the availability zones the load balancer will be for
- Assign a security group to the load balancer
	- Should create a new security group (one that only allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic and not SSH)
- Listeners listen on the protocol and port selected
	- HTTP = 80
	- HTTPS = 443
- Routing to a target group
	- The traffic comes in on HTTP/HTTPS and the listener forwards (routes) the traffic to the target group
	- We need to create a target group
		- The target group is just a group of instances that the load balance will route traffic to
