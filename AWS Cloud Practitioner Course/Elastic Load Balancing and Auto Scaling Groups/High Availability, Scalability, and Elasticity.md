- Scalability
	- Means than an application/system can handle greater loads by adapting
	- Two kinds of scalability
		- Vertical
		- Horizontal (elasticity)
	- Vertical scalability
		- Means increasing the size of the instance
			- Scaling from a t2.micro to a t2.xlarge, for example
		- Very common for non-distributed systems such as a database
		- There's usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit)
	- Horizontal scalability
		- Means increasing the number of instances/systems for your application
		- Implies distributed systems
		- Very common for web applications/modern applications
		- Easy to horizontally scale thanks to the cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2
		- Uses Auto Scaling Groups and Load Balancers
- High Availability
	- Goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
	- Means running your application/system in at least 2 AZs
	- The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss (disaster)
- Formal definitions
	- Scalability
		- The ability to accomodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger (vertical) or by adding nodes (horizontal)
	- Elasticity
		- Once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some "auto-scaling" so that the system can scale based on the load
		- This is "cloud-friendly"
		- Pay-per-use
		- Match demand
		- Optimize costs
	- Agility
		- New IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes
