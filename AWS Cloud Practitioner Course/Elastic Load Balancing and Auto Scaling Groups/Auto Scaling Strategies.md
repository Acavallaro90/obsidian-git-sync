- Manual scaling
	- Update the size of an ASG manually
- Dynamic scaling
	- Respond to changing demand
	- Simple/step scaling
		- When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
		- When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1 unit
	- Target Tracking scaling
		- Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
	- Scheduled scaling
		- Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
	- Predicitive scaling
		- Uses machine learning to predict future traffic ahead of time
