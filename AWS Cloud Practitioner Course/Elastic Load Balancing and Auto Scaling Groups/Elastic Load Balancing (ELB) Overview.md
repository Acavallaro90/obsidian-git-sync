- Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 instances) downstream
- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Do regular health checks to your instances
	- Unhealthy instances will not get traffic sent to them
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
- High availibility across zones
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
	- An AWS managed load balancer
	- AWS guarantees that it will be working
	- AWS takes care of
		- Upgrades
		- Maintenance
		- High availability
	- AS provides only a few configuration knobs
		- What you need to configure is minimal
	- It costs less to setup your own load balancer, but it will be a lot more effort on your end (maintenance, integrations)
- Four kinds of load balancers offered by AWS
	- Application Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS only)
		- Layer 7
		- Keywords
			- HTTP
			- HTTPS
			- gRPC
			- HTTP routing features
			- Static DNS (URL)
	- Network Load Balancer (ultra-high performance, allows for TCP)
		- Layer 4
		- Keywords
			- TCP
			- UDP
			- High performance (millions of requests per second)
			- Static IP through Elastic IP
	- Gateway Load Balancer
		- Layer 3
		- Keywords
			- GENEVE on IP packets
			- Route traffic to firewalls that you manage on EC2 instances
			- Intrusion detection
	- Classic Load Balancer (retired in 2023)
		- Layer 4 and 7
