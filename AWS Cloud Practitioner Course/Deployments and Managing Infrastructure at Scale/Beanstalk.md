- Developer problems on AWS
	- Managing infrastructure
	- Deploying code
	- Configuring all the databases, load balancers, etc.
	- Scaling concerns
	- Most web applications have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
	- All the developers want is for their code to run
	- Possibly, consistently across different applications and environments
- Beanstalk
	- A developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
	- It uses all the components we've seen before
		- EC2
		- ASG
		- ELB
		- RDS
		- Etc
	- It's all in one view that's easy to make sense of
	- We still have full control over the configuration
	- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	- Free but you pay for the underlying instances
	- Managed service by Beanstalk
		- Instance configuration
		- Operating System
		- Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Beanstalk
		- Capacity provisioning
		- Load balancing
		- Auto scaling
		- Application health-monitoring and responsiveness
	- User is responsible for just the application code
- Three architecture models
	- Single instance deployment
		- Good for development environments
	- Load balancer and auto scaling group
		- Great for production or pre-production web applications
	- Auto scaling group only
		- Great for non-web applications in production
