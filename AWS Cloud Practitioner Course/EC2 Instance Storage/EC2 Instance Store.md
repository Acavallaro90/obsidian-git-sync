- EBS volumes are network drives with "good" but limited performance
- If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
- Pros
	- Better I/O performance
	- Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content
- Cons
	- EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
	- Not good for long-term storage
	- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
	- Backup and replication are your responsibility
