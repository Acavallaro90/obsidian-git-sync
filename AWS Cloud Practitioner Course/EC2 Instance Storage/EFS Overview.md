- EFS
	- Elastic File System
	- Managed Network File System (NFS) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2 instances
	- Works only with Linux EC2 instances and across multiple AZs
	- Highly available
	- Scalable
	- Expensive (3x gp2)
	- Pay per use
	- No capacity planning
- EBS vs EFS
	- EBS can only be applied to a single EC2 instance in a single AZ
		- Snapshots can be made and copied over to create another EBS for another EC2 instance in another AZ
	- EFS is a shared drive that all EC2 instances can use across all AZs
		- No snapshots needed
		- More expensive
		- Uses an EFS Mount Target
- EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)
	- Storage class that is cost-optimized for files that are not accessed every day
	- Up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
	- EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed
	- A lifecycle policy is set to move these files based on the last read/write time on them
		- If times passes the time set in the lifecycle policy, the files will be moved to EFS-IA
