- EBS Volume
	- Elastic Block Store
	- A network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
	- It allows your instances to persist data even after their termination
	- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time
	- They are bound to a specific availability zone
		- You cannot attach an EBS in us-east-1 to a us-east-2 EC2 instance
		- You cannot attach an EBS in us-east-1a to a us-east-1b EC2 instance
	- Basically think of them as network "USB Sticks"
	- A network drive (not a physical drive)
		- It uses the network to communicate with the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
	- It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another EC2 instance quickly
	- Super handy for failover type scenarios
	- Locked to an Availability Zone
		- Bypass is to create a snapshot and then you can move it from availability zones
	- Has a provisioned capacity
		- Size in GB or TB
		- I/O operations per second
		- You get billed for the provisioned capacity
		- You can increase the capacity of the drive over time
	- Delete on termination attribute
		- Controls the behavior of an EBS volume when an EC2 instance is terminated
		- By default, the root EBS is deleted on termination
		- By default, any other attached EBS is not deleted on termination
