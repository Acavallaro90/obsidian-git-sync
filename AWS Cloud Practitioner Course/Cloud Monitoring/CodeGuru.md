- A machine learning service for automated code reviews and application performance recommendations
- Provides two functionalities
	- Reviewer
		- Automated code reviews for static code analysis (development)
		- Uses machine learning and automated reasoning
		- Hard-learned lessons across millions of code reviews on 1000s of open-source and Amazon repositories
		- Supports
			- Java
			- Python
		- Integrates with
			- GitHub
			- Bitbucket
			- AWS CodeCommit
		- Identify critical issues
		- Identify security vulnerabilities
		- Identify hard-to-find bugs
		- Example:
			- Common coding best practices
			- Resource leaks
			- Security detection
			- Input validation
	- Profiler
		- Visibility/recommendations about application performance during runtime (production)
		- Helps understand the runtime behavior of your application
		- Example: identify if your application is consuming excessive CPU capacity on a logging routine
		- Features
			- Identify and remove code inefficiencies
			- Improve application performance
				- Reduce CPU utilization
			- Decrease compute costs
			- Provide heap summary
				- Identify which objects are using up memory
			- Anomaly detection
		- Support applications running on AWS or on-premises
		- Minimal overhead on application
