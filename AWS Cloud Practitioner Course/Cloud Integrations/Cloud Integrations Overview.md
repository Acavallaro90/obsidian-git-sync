- When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another
- Two types of patterns for application communication
	- Synchronous communication
		- Application to application
		- Can be problematic if there are sudden spikes of traffic
		- Example: what if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but usually its 10?
			- In that case, it's better to decouple your applications using
				- SQS queue model
				- SNS pub/sub model
				- Kinesis real time data streaming model
	- Asynchronous communication/event based
		- Application to queue to application
