- AWS Regions:
	- AWS has regions all around the world
	- Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3, etc.
	- A region is a cluster of data centers
	- Most AWS services are region-scoped
- How to choose an AWS region
	- Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
		- Data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
		- Proximity to customers: reduced latency
		- Available services within a region: new services and new features aren't available in every region
		- Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
- AWS Availability Zones:
	- Each region has many availability zones
		- Usually 3 (minimum is 3 and maximum is 6)
	- Each availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
	- They're separate from each other so that they're isolated from disasters
	- They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
