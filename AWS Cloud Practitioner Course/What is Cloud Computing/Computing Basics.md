- How websites work:
	- A client (web browser) uses a network connection (Wi-Fi) to transmit a request to a server to receive a webpage in which the server responds and sends the webpage back to the client
	- Clients and servers both use IP addresses so the network knows where to route traffic
- What is a server composed of?
	- Compute: CPU
	- Memory: RAM
	- Storage: data
	- Database: data stored in a structured way
	- Network: routers, switches, DNS server
- IT Terminology:
	- Network: cables, routers, and servers connected with each other
	- Router: a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks (they know where to send your packets on the internet)
	- Switch: takes a packet and sends it to the correct server/client on your network
- Problems with traditional IT approach:
	- Pay for the rent for the data center
	- Pay for power supply, cooling, and maintenance of servers
	- Adding and replacing hardware takes time
	- Scaling is limited
	- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
	- How to deal with disasters (earthquakes, power shutdown, fire, etc.)
