- Cloud computing: the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go-pricing
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
- Simple way to access servers, storage databases, and a set of application services
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application
- The Deployment Models of the Cloud:
	- Private Cloud
		- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public
		- Complete control
		- Security for sensitive applications
		- Meet specific business needs
	- Public Cloud
		- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
		- Six advantages of cloud computing
	- Hybrid Cloud
		- Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud
		- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
		- Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud
- The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
	- On-demand self service: users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
	- Broad network access: resources available over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
	- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling: multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy; multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
	- Rapid elasticity and scalability: automatically and quickly acquire and dispose of resources when needed; quickly and easily scale based on demand
	- Measured service: usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used
- The Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
	- Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
		- Pay on-demand
		- Don't own hardware
		- Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) and operational expense (OPEX)
	- Benefit from massive economies of scale
		- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
	- Stop guessing capacity
		- Scale based on actual measured usage
	- Increase speed and agility
	- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
	- Go global in minutes
		- Leverage the AWS global infrastructure
- Problems solved by the cloud
	- Flexibility: change resource types when needed
	- Cost-effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
	- Scalability: accomodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
	- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale in when needed
	- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
	- Agility: rapidly develop, test, and launch software applications
