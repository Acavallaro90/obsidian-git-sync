- Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don't have to manage servers anymore
- They just deploy code or functions
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that's managed
	- Databases
	- Messaging
	- Storage
	- Etc.
- Serverless does not mean there are no servers
	- It means, the user (me) just don't manage/provision/see the servers
