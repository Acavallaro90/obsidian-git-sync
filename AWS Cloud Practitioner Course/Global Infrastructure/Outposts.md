- Hybrid Cloud
	- Businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
- Two ways of dealing with IT systems
	- One for the AWS Cloud
		- AWS Console
		- AWS CLI
		- AWS APIs
	- One for the on-premises infrastructure
- AWS Outposts
	- Server racks that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
	- AWS will setup and manage "Outposts Racks" within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
	- You are now responsible for the Outposts Racks physical security
- Benefits

	- Local data processing
	- Data residency
	- Easier migration from on-premises to the cloud
	- Fully managed service
