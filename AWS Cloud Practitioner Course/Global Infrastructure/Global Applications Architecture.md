- Single Region + Single AZ
	- No high availability
	- No global latency
	- Simple setup
- Single Region + Multi AZ
	- High availability
	- No global latency
	- Little more difficult
- Multi Region + Multi AZ (1 AZ in each Region)
	- Active-Passive
	- 1 region is active
		- Read/write
	- 1 region is passive
		- Read only
	- Global reads' latency
	- No global writes' latency
	- More difficult
- Multi Region + Multi AZ (1 AZ in each region)
	- Active-Active
	- Both regions are read/write
	- Global reads' latency
	- Global writes' latency
	- More difficult
