- Global application
	- An application deployed in multiple geographies
	- This could be regions and/or edge locations
	- Pros
		- Decreased latency
			- Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server
			- It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the United States
			- Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency and provide a better experience
		- Disaster recovery
			- If an AWS region goes down (natural disaster, politics, etc.)
			- You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working
			- A disaster recovery plan is important to increase the availability of your application
		- Attack protection
			- Distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack
- Regions
	- For deploying applications and infrastructure
	- Made of Availability Zones
- Availability Zones
	- Made up of multiple data centers
- Edge Locations (Points of Presence)
	- For content delivery as close as possible to users
- Route 53
	- For Global DNS
	- Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
	- Great for disaster recovery strategies
- CloudFront
	- For Global Content Delivery Network (CDN)
	- Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations
	- Decrease latency
	- Cache common requests to improve user experience and decrease latency
- S3 Transfer Acceleration
	- Accelerate global uploads and downloads into Amazon S3
- AWS Global Accelerator
	- Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
