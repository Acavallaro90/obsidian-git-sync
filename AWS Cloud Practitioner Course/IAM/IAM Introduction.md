- IAM (Identity and Access Management)
	- Global service
	- Root account created by default
		- Shouldn't be used or shared
- IAM Users
	- Users are people within your organization and can be grouped
	- Users don't have to belong to a group but a user can belong to multiple groups
- IAM Groups
	- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- IAM Permissions
	- Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
	- These policies define the permissions of the users
	- In AWS, you apply the least privelege principle
		- Don't give more permissions than a user needs
