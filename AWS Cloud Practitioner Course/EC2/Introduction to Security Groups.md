- Security groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
- They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances
- Security groups only contain ALLOW rules
- Security group rules can reference by IP or by security group

- Security groups are acting as a "firewall" on EC2 instances (see image)
- Security groups regulate
	- Access to ports
	- Authorized IP ranges
		- IPv4 and IPv6
	- Control of inbound network (from external to the EC2 instance)
	- Control of outbound network (from the EC2 instance to the external)

- Security groups good to know
	- Can be attached to multiple instances
	- Locked down to a region/VPC combination
	- Lives "outside" the EC2 instance - if trafic is blocked, the EC2 instance won't see it
	- It's good to maintain one separate security group just for SSH access
	- If your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue
	- If your application gives a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched
	- By default
		- All inbound traffic is blocked
		- All outbound traffic is authorized

		- Upload files using SSH
	- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
		- Upload files into a file share
	- 80 = HTTP
		- Access unsecured websites
	- 443 = HTTPS
		- Access secured websites
	- 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
		- Login to a Windows instance
- Inbound rules
	- The rules that allow connectivity to the EC2 instance from the outside world
	- 0.0.0.0/0 means anywhere
