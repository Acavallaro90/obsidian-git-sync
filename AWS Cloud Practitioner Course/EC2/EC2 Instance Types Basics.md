- You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimized for different use cases
	- https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
- AWS has the following naming convention
	- m5.2xlarge
		- m: instance class
		- 5: generation of the instance (AWS improves them over time)
		- 2xlarge: size within the instance class
- EC2 Instance Types
	- General Purpose
		- Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
		- Balance between
			- Compute
			- Memory
			- Networking
	- Compute Optimized
		- Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors
			- Batch processing workloads
			- Media transcoding
			- High performance web servers
			- High performance computing (HPC)
			- Scientific modeling
			- Machine learning
			- Dedicated gaming servers
	- Memory Optimized
		- Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
		- Use cases
			- High performance, relational/non-relational databases
			- Distributed web scale cache stores
			- In-memory databases optimized for business intelligence (BI)
			- Applications performing real-time processing of big, unstructured data
	- Storage Optimized
		- Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
		- Use cases
			- High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
			- Relational and No-SQL databases
